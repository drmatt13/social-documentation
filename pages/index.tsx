          Banned Social - Project Documentation Introduction
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm xl:text-base mt-8 xl:mt-12">
          Welcome to the project documentation of Banned Social, an innovative
          and audacious web application that transcends the traditional paradigm
          of social networking by fostering a platform for global political
          discourse.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm xl:text-base mt-7 xl:mt-8">
          Banned Social is built around the belief that free speech, open
          dialogue, and diverse perspectives are crucial for a healthy and
          well-functioning democracy. In an era of digital division and echo
          chambers, Banned Social seeks to create a community where individuals
          of all political beliefs can not only express their views but also
          engage in challenging debates and meaningful discussions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm xl:text-base mt-7 xl:mt-8">
          Unlike the conventional models of social media platforms, Banned
          Social does not restrict the visibility of posts through selective
          algorithms. Instead, it presents a truly global newsfeed that reflects
          the real-time pulse of worldwide political discussions. The posts are
          displayed in chronological order, ensuring a fair representation of
          every user{"'"}s viewpoint without prioritizing based on popularity or
          personal preferences.
        </p>

          Upon joining, users are encouraged to choose an avatar from a diverse
          catalog, ranging from historical characters, wojaks, political
          leaders, and religious symbols to representations of LGBTQ+ concepts
          and extraterrestrial beings. This aspect of personalization infuses an
          element of fun and individuality while enhancing user identification
          and interaction.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm xl:text-base mt-7 xl:mt-8">

          community.
